                <p class="text">More than 4,000 naturally occurring minerals are inorganic solids that have a characteristic chemical composition and 
                    specific crystal structure have been found on Earth.
                    They are formed of simple molecules or individual elements arranged 
                    in repeating chains, sheets, or three-dimensional arrays.</p>

                <p class="text">Minerals are typically formed when molten rock, or magma, cools, 
                    or by separating out of mineral-rich water, such as that in underground caverns. In general, mineral particles are small, 
                    having formed within confined areas such as lava flows or between grains of sediments. Large crystals
                    found in geodes and other rocks are relatively rare.</p>
