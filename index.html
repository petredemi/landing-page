                    <p>On this site you will find some amasing things
                    about minerals.</p>
                    <p>Minerals form when atoms bond together in a crystalline arrangement.</p>
                    <p>Many minerals form beautiful crystals, but the most prized of all are gemstones. 
                        Uncut gems often look fairly ordinary like rocks. It's only when they are cut and polished that they obtain 
                        the brilliance and luster that gives them their value.</p>

                <p class="info">Quartz is a hard mineral formed of tetrahedra crystals composed of silicon dioxide SiO2.
                    It is the second most abundant mineral in Earth's continental crust.
                    There are many different varieties of quartz, several of which are classified as gemstones. Since antiquity, varieties of 
                    quartz have been the most commonly used minerals in the making 
                    of jewelry and hardstone carvings.

                <p class="info">Pyrite- cubic cristals of FeS2, a sulfide mineral,
                    it's color resambles gold, and is known as stone which burn.Pyrite is used to make marcasite jewelry. 
                    Marcasite jewelry, made from small faceted pieces of pyrite, often set in silver, was 
                    known since ancient times and was popular in the Victorian era
                
                  </p>
                <p class="info">Stibnite, known as well as Antimonite, which are cristals orthorhombic of Sb2S3.Pastes of Sb2S3 powder in fat[9] or in other materials have been used since 
                    ca. 3000 BC as eye cosmetics in the Mediterranean and farther afield; in this use, Sb2S3 is called kohl. It was used to darken the brows and lashes, 
                    or to draw a line around the perimeter of the eye. </p>
                <p class="info">Marcasite and Quartz minerals. The mineral marcasite, sometimes called "white iron pyrite", is iron sulfide (FeS2) with orthorhombic crystal structure what it make it
                    distinct from pyrite.Both giving them different physical properties.Marcasite jewellery is frequently made by setting small pieces of faceted pyrite into silver.

                <p>More than 4,000 naturally occurring minerals are inorganic solids that have a characteristic chemical composition and 
                    specific crystal structure have been found on Earth.
                    They are formed of simple molecules or individual elements arranged 
                    in repeating chains, sheets, or three-dimensional arrays.</p>

                <p>Minerals are typically formed when molten rock, or magma, cools, 
                    or by separating out of mineral-rich water, such as that in underground caverns. In general, mineral particles are small, 
                    having formed within confined areas such as lava flows or between grains of sediments. Large crystals
                    found in geodes and other rocks are relatively rare.</p>
                
                <p>Rocks themselves are made of clusters or mixtures of minerals, and minerals and 
                rocks affect landform development and form natural 
                resources such as gold, tin, iron, marble, and granite.</p>
                <p>Silicates, including quartz, mica, olivine, and precious minerals such as emeralds 
                are the most common class of minerals, as well as the major components of most rocks. Oxides, sulfides, sulfates, 
                carbonates, and halides are other major mineral classes.</p>
