                    <p>On this site you will find some amasing things
                    about minerals.</p>
                    <p>Minerals form when atoms bond together in a crystalline arrangement.</p>
                    <p>Many minerals form beautiful crystals, but the most prized of all are gemstones. 
                        Uncut gems often look fairly ordinary like rocks. It's only when they are cut and polished that they obtain 
                        the brilliance and luster that gives them their value.</p>

                <p class="text">More than 4,000 naturally occurring minerals are inorganic solids that have a characteristic chemical composition and 
                    specific crystal structure have been found on Earth.
                    They are formed of simple molecules or individual elements arranged 
                    in repeating chains, sheets, or three-dimensional arrays.</p>

                <p class="text">Minerals are typically formed when molten rock, or magma, cools, 
                    or by separating out of mineral-rich water, such as that in underground caverns. In general, mineral particles are small, 
                    having formed within confined areas such as lava flows or between grains of sediments. Large crystals
                    found in geodes and other rocks are relatively rare.</p>
                </p>
                <p>Rocks themselves are made of clusters or mixtures of minerals, and minerals and 
                rocks affect landform development and form natural 
                resources such as gold, tin, iron, marble, and granite.</p>
                <p>Silicatesâ€”including quartz, mica, olivine, and precious minerals such as emeralds 
                are the most common class of minerals, as well as the major components of most rocks. Oxides, sulfides, sulfates, 
                carbonates, and halides are other major mineral classes.</p>
