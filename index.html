                    <p>Many minerals look often fairly ordinary like rocks, and should be cut and polished to get 
                       brilliance and luster.</p>

                <p class="info">Quartz is a hard mineral formed of tetrahedra crystals composed of silicon dioxide SiO2.
                    It is the second most abundant mineral in Earth's continental crust.
                    Since antiquity
                    quartz have been the most used mineral in the making 
                    of jewelry.

                <p class="info">Pyrite- cubic cristals of FeS2, a sulfide mineral,
                    it's color resambles gold, and is known as stone which burn. Pyrite is used to make marcasite jewelry. 
                  </p>
                <p class="info">Stibnite, known as well as Antimonite, which are cristals orthorhombic of Sb2S3. 
                    have been used since 
                    ca. 3000 BC as eye cosmetics. It was used to darken the brows and lashes, 
                    or to draw a line around the perimeter of the eye. </p>
                <p class="info">Marcasite and Quartz minerals. The mineral marcasite, sometimes called "white iron pyrite", 
                    is iron sulfide (FeS2) with orthorhombic crystal structure what it make it
                    distinct from pyrite.

                <p>More than 4,000 naturally occurring minerals have been found on Earth. They are inorganic solids that have a 
                    characteristic chemical composition and specific crystal structure 
                    They are formed of simple molecules or individual elements arranged 
                    in repeating chains, sheets, or three-dimensional arrays.</p>

                <p>Minerals are typically formed when molten rock, or magma, cools, 
                    or by separating out of mineral-rich water, such as that in underground caverns. In general, mineral particles are small, 
                    having formed within confined areas such as lava flows or between grains of sediments. Large crystals are
                    found in geodes and other rocks.</p>
                
                <p>Rocks themselves are made of clusters or mixtures of minerals, and minerals and 
                rocks affect landform development and form natural 
                resources such as gold, tin, iron, marble, and granite.</p>
                <p>Silicates, including quartz, mica, olivine, and precious minerals such as emeralds 
                are the most common class of minerals, as well as the major components of most rocks. Oxides, sulfides, sulfates, 
                carbonates, and halides are other major mineral classes.</p>
